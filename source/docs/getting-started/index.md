[Hexo](https://hexo.io) is a fast and powerful static blog generating framework, it's based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). By using Hexo you can write articles easily with Markdown, and besides the grammer of Markdown, you can also use [tag plugins](https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins) provided by Hexo to insert special formated content simply. In this page we assume you have installed Hexo and created a site with it.

{% note info %}
You can visit [Hexo Docs](https://hexo.io/docs/) to see how to install Hexo. Make sure that the version of Node.js and Hexo in the environment is higher than [the minimum requirements](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next#readme) of the NexT theme, and then continue with the following steps.
{% endnote %}

### Configuration

There are two main configuration files using by Hexo and both called `_config.yml`:

  1. The first one is under {% label info@site root directory %}, which contains Hexo's config.
  2. The second one is under {% label primary@theme root directory %}, which is provided by NexT and contains theme's config.

Let's call the first one – {% label info@site config file %}, and the second one – {% label primary@theme config file %}.
However, we do not recommend directly modifying the {% label primary@theme config file %}. It is quite often running into conflict status when updating NexT theme via `git pull`, or need to merge configurations manually when upgrading to new releases. For Hexo 5.0 or later, the theme can be installed through npm and it is also difficult to modify the {% label primary@theme config file %} in `node_modules`.

In order to resolve this issue, we recommend using the [Alternate Theme Config](/docs/getting-started/configuration.html) feature to configure theme NexT.

### NexT Installation

It's easy to install Hexo theme: you can just download the NexT theme, copy the theme folder to the `themes` directory under {% label info@site root directory %} and specify in {% label info@site config file %} your {% label primary@theme root directory %}. The detailed steps are as follows:

#### Downloading NexT

{% tabs downloading-next %}
<!-- tab Using <code>npm</code> -->
If you're using Hexo 5.0 or later, the simplest way to install is through npm.

Open your Terminal, change to Hexo {% label info@site root directory %} and install NexT theme:
```bash
$ cd hexo-site
$ npm install hexo-theme-next
```
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab Using <code>git</code> -->
If you know about [Git](https://git-scm.com), you can clone the whole repository and update it in any time with `git pull` command instead of downloading archive manually.

Open your terminal, change to Hexo {% label info@site root directory %} and clone latest master branch of NexT theme:
```bash
$ cd hexo-site
$ git clone https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next themes/next
```
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab Download zip -->
1. Go to NexT version [Release Page](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next/releases).
2. Choose the version you need and download the Source Code (zip) in the Download section. For example v8.0.0-rc.3.
3. Extract the zip file to site's themes directory and rename the extracted folder (`hexo-theme-next-8.0.0-rc.3`) to `next`.
<!-- endtab -->
{% endtabs %}

{% note primary %}
You also can read [detailed installation instructions](/docs/getting-started/installation.html) if you want any other installation variant.
{% endnote %}

{% note warning %}
If you are still using NexT version 5, you can read [instructions for update from v5 to v8](/docs/getting-started/update-from-v5.html).
{% endnote %}

#### Enabling NexT

Like all Hexo themes, after you download it, open {% label info@site config file %}, find `theme` section, and change its value to `next` (or another theme directory name).

```yml hexo/_config.yml
theme: next
```

Now you have installed NexT theme and enabled it. The following steps will help you verify whether NexT is enabled correctly.

#### Checking NexT

It's recommended to use `hexo clean` to clean Hexo's cache first.
Then start Hexo local server with debug parameter (by adding `--debug`), the whole command is `hexo s --debug`. You can see the output while running, and if you find problem, you can use the output to help others locate error better. When it prints:

```
INFO  Hexo is running at http://localhost:4000/. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

Now you can open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser, and check whether the site works correctly.

{% note success %}
If you find your site looks like this picture, you have installed it correctly. That's default NexT scheme – Muse.
![Default Scheme – Muse](/images/docs/next-default-scheme.png)
{% endnote %}

If everything is OK, in next steps we will change some settings including personalization and third-party services integration.

### Hexo Configuration

The following settings in {% label info@site config file %} are very helpful for optimizing your website.

#### Configuring Author

Edit {% label info@site config file %} and set the value of `author` to your nickname.

```yml hexo/_config.yml
# Site
author:
```

#### Configuring Description

Edit {% label info@site config file %} and set the value of `description` to your description, which can be a sentence you like.

```yml hexo/_config.yml
# Site
description:
```

After that we can [configure deployment](/docs/getting-started/deployment.html).

### NexT Configuration

#### Choosing Scheme

Scheme is a feature supported by NexT, by using Scheme NexT gives you different views. And nearly all config can be used by those Schemes. Till now NexT supports 4 schemes, and they are:

* **`Muse`** → Default Scheme, this is the initial version of NexT. Uses black-white tone and mainly looks cleanly.
* `Mist` → A tighter version of Muse with a tidy single-column view.
* `Pisces` → Double-column Scheme, fresh like your neighbor's daughter.
* `Gemini` → Looks like Pisces, but have distinct column blocks with shadow to appear more sensitive to view.

You can change Scheme by editing {% label primary@theme config file %}, searching `scheme` keyword. You'll see 4 lines of scheme settings and can enable one of them by removing it's `#` and added `#` to previous.

```yml next/_config.yml
#scheme: Muse
#scheme: Mist
#scheme: Pisces
scheme: Gemini
```

#### Dark Mode

You can enable Dark Mode by setting `darkmode` to `true` in {% label primary@theme config file %}.

```yml next/_config.yml
darkmode: true
```

The `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature is used to bring Dark Mode to all 4 schemes above, make sure your browser supports it.

{% caniuse prefers-color-scheme @ current,past_1,past_2,past_3,past_4,past_5 %}

Theme NexT automatically shows Dark Mode if the OS prefered theme is dark. It's supported by macOS Mojave, iOS 13 and Android 10 or later. Relevant docs:
[How to use Dark Mode on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208976)
[Use Dark Mode on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210332)
[Dark theme | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme)

#### Configuring Menu Items

Menu settings items have format `Key: /link/ || icon` which contains 3 values:

{% tabs menu-items %}
<!-- tab <code>Key</code> -->
`Key` → is the name of menu item (`home`, `archives`, etc.).
If translate for this menu will be found in languages, this translate will be loaded; if not, `Key` name will be used.
{% note danger %}
`Key` value is case sensitive (e.g. `home` is not same as `Home`).
{% endnote %}
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab <code>link</code> -->
Value before `||` delimeter (`/link/`) → is the target link to relative url inside your site.
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab <code>icon</code> -->
Value after `||` delimeter (`icon`) → is the name of FontAwesome icon.
Names of that icons can be found in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) site.
<!-- endtab -->
{% endtabs %}

By default, all menu items are commented out to ensure that you can override them in the [Alternate Theme Config](/docs/getting-started/configuration.html).
To customize menu items, edit the following content in {% label primary@theme config file %}:

```yml next/_config.yml
menu:
  home: / || fa fa-home
  #about: /about/ || fa fa-user
  #tags: /tags/ || fa fa-tags
  #categories: /categories/ || fa fa-th
  archives: /archives/ || fa fa-archive
  #schedule: /schedule/ || fa fa-calendar
  #sitemap: /sitemap.xml || fa fa-sitemap
  #commonweal: /404/ || fa fa-heartbeat
```

{% note warning %}
Except `home` and `archives`, all custom pages under `menu` section need to be created manually. See [«Custom Page Support»](/docs/theme-settings/#Custom-Page-Support)
{% endnote %}

Dynamic sub-menu within hierarchy structure is also supported. Add your sub-menu items in `menu` section in {% label primary@theme config file %} as following:

```yml next/_config.yml
menu:
  home: / || fa fa-home
  archives: /archives/ || fa fa-archive
  Docs:
    default: /docs/ || fa fa-book
    Third Party Services:
      default: /third-party-services/ || fa fa-plug
      Algolia Search: /algolia-search/ || fa fa-search-plus
```

{% note info %}
If your site runs in a sub-directory, please remove the prefix `/` from the link.
{% endnote %}

By default NexT shows the icons of menu items without badges.

{% tabs menu_settings %}
<!-- tab <code>icons</code> -->
You can configure it by editing values in `menu_settings.icons` section in {% label primary@theme config file %}.

```yml next/_config.yml
menu_settings:
  icons: true
```
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab <code>badges</code> -->
Set the value `badges` to `true` to display the count of Posts / Categories / Tags within menu items in `menu_settings` section in {% label primary@theme config file %} as following:

```yml next/_config.yml
menu_settings:
  badges: true
```
<!-- endtab -->

{% endtabs %}

#### Configuring Favicon

By default the Hexo site use NexT favicons in `hexo-site/themes/next/source/images/` directory with different size for different device. You can replace them with your own favicons.

For example, you can put your favicons in `hexo-site/source/images/` directory. Then you need to rename them and change the settings in `favicon` section in {% label primary@theme config file %}, otherwise icons from Next will rewrite your custom icons in Hexo.

You can also put custom favicons into `hexo-site/source/` directory. In this way, you **must remove** `/images` prefix from paths.

To generate custom favicons, you can visit [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net).

```yml hexo/_config.yml
favicon:
  small: /images/favicon-16x16-next.png
  medium: /images/favicon-32x32-next.png
  apple_touch_icon: /images/apple-touch-icon-next.png
  safari_pinned_tab: /images/logo.svg
  android_manifest: /images/manifest.json
  ms_browserconfig: /images/browserconfig.xml
```

#### Configuring Avatar

By default NexT doesn't show avatar in sidebar. You can configure it by editing values under `avatar` setting in {% label primary@theme config file %}.

{% tabs avatar %}
<!-- tab <code>url</code> -->
For first test you can uncomment `/images/avatar.gif` value near the `avatar.url` setting to see default avatar:

```yml next/_config.yml
avatar:
  url: /images/avatar.gif
```

Then you need to specify your own avatar. It can be done one of the ways below:

{% subtabs avatar1 %}
<!-- tab {% label success@Hexo directory %} -->
Put your avatar under {% label info@site directory %} `source/uploads/` (create directory if it doesn't exists).
And then change option to `avatar: /uploads/avatar.png`.
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab NexT directory -->
Put your avatar under {% label primary@theme directory %} `source/images/`.
And then change option to `avatar: /images/avatar.png`.

{% note info %}
Current site uses avatar under {% label primary@theme directory %} from file located in `next/source/images/apple-touch-icon-next.png` with following config:

```yml hexo/_config.yml
theme_config:
  avatar:
    url: /images/apple-touch-icon-next.png
    rounded: true
    rotated: false
```

{% endnote %}
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab Absolute URL from Internet -->
You also can specify any external URL with absolute path to image: `http(s)://example.com/avatar.png`
<!-- endtab -->
{% endsubtabs %}
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab <code>rounded</code> -->
Set up rounded of avatar by changing the value of `avatar.rounded`:

* `true` → Avatar will be rounded.
* **`false`** → Avatar will be squared.

```yml next/_config.yml
avatar:
  rounded: true
```
<!-- endtab -->

<!-- tab <code>rotated</code> -->
Set up rotated of avatar by changing the value of `avatar.rotated`:

* `true` → Avatar will be rotate under the mouse hovering.
* **`false`** → Avatar will not rotate under the mouse hovering.

```yml next/_config.yml
avatar:
  rotated: true
```

<!-- endtab -->
{% endtabs %}
